# A scapy implementation of Slowloris

This aims at being an alternative version of Slowloris built on top of the Scapy library for Python.
Made by Matheus Augusto da Silva and Alessandro Montaldo for the course
SR2I203. Modified for use as part of the project on SR2I207, in the
context of Web application's penetration testing.

To run the code, be sure to have scapy installed:

```
pip install scapy
```

Run the following command the make sure the Kernel won't drop TCP connections generated by scapy:

```
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP
```

Since the code manipulates TCP connections, it needs to be run as root or with
sudo. Usage statement can be called with:

```
chmod 755 loris.py
./loris.py --help
sudo ./loris.py <TARGET> <OPTIONS>
```
